# djangogirls-tutorial-mindmap
Mind map of DjangoGirls tutorial (including its extension on security)

After participating in DjangoGirls event I started to work on my own project and found using the tutorial as a reference rather time-consuming. I made a mind map to present the information in more compact and structured way, including the console commands, files and code examples used at each step. I tried to rewrite the code examples with "abstract" names, but got tired with it by the Django Forms part, so in the last two subtopics of the application section the code is left as it was in the tutorial.

XMind application can be found here http://www.xmind.net/  

Here is a preview (in XMind you can unfold each step with a plus in the circle to see the code).
